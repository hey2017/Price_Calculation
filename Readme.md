Stock price forecasting
In this project I create an app which you can predict the price of stocks for specific future time frames.  

## Technical requirements
For this analysis you need to have python installed and have the following libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Propeht](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)
- [yahoo finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)

## Run the code
To run the code, you can use the file ```P_C.py```.
